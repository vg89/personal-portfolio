//we use an empty tag which is called react fragment


// But there is a very important difference between React fragment and Empty tag, that is, one can use the key attribute in React Fragment syntaxes but in empty tag syntax thatâ€™s not possible.

//react fragment is all about creating great reusable components. By using React Fragments we can get rid of the extra wrapper element that we had to use whenever multiple elements needed to be rendered by a component.

//ml-[-100px] is used to take the linked icon to the back side of the page

//hover rounded-md-->this adds border radius of 6px
//hover:ml-[-10px], it means on hover we have to decrease the margin left by 10px

//instead of copying the 4 links (linkedin, github,and so on), we create a const links array

// to add custom css for just one specific link : we have to do this {'flex justify-between items-center w-40 h-14 px-4 ml-[-100px]hover:ml-[-10px] hover:rounded-md duration-300 bg-gray-500' + " " +style}
